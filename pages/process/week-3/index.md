title: "Week 3: Broken Code"
---

We had our first in-person meeting with Dr. Sirovic, where we made a trip down to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography campus.  We received the code implementing the current CNN code and got a further in-depth description of what we would be working on.  We came up with a rough timeline, and gave the overview presentation that we planned last week.  Lastly, we began working on running the code we were given in its existing state.
