We finish up our tasks: Jeremy and Rochelle finish up classifying the training data and finalize the report.  Luis and Tiffany finish up implementing the GUI, integrating all the parts into one functional GUI program.  We give the class a final oral presentation of what we have worked on the whole quarter and what we accomplished. Lastly, our final task for this class is to write up a final report on our project, collaborated with the detector team.  One of our team members may continue this project after the class is over.
